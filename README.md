# dropdownizer

This generates a details-summery dropdown from a Gutenberg group.

## Usage

* Set up a new group block
* Add a heading. Can be any level.
* Add any content below, but still in the group block
* Give the group a class of "dropdown"

That's it; WordPress will render that as a dropdown on the live site. (The dropdown will not appear in the editor view.)
